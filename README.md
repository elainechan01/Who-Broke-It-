🗝 Escape Room - Python for Beginners

✏ Elaine Chan &copy; 2022

## Task:
Our program has been attacked by a ransomware. We were given an anonymous tip about the potential suspect for the attack. Debug the program to figure out the culprit. 

## Exceptions and Constraints:

- Existing code should not be modified unless specified (code blocks to be modified/fixed will be identified under `<----- ACTION NEEDED HERE ----->`)
- The `culprit_name_len` cannot be hardcoded into the `main.py` file, it should be imported from the `anonymous.py` file

## Expected Output:
```
Anna
```
